These binaries are from Timendus' [test suite for
Chip8](https://github.com/Timendus/chip8-test-suite/tree/main/bin).
The .8o files are the original source code, the .ch8 files the built
code and the .asm files are a translation into GoodASM format.

If correct, rebuilding the .ch8 from the .asm files should not change
its hash at all.
