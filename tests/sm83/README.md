This first GameBoy/SM83 test case comes from
[main.asm](https://github.com/NotImplementedLife/Gameboy-ASM-Examples/blob/master/0.hello-world/main.asm)
in the [GameBoy ASM
Examples](https://github.com/NotImplementedLife/Gameboy-ASM-Examples/).
Its purpose is to know that the assembler works, but the syntax of our
two assemblers has a few differences and this version does not depend
upon RGBDS.
